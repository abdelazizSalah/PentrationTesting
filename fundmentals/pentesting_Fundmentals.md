# Pentesting Fundmentals
* Pentesting is finding vulnerabilities in clients application or system
* It is an ethically-driven attempt to test and analyse the security defences to protect these assets and pieces of information.
* Before a penetration test starts, a formal discussion occurs between the penetration tester and the system owner. Various tools, techniques, and systems to be tested are agreed on. This discussion forms the scope of the penetration testing agreement and will determine the course the penetration test takes.
* Before a pentester perform his test, he must create a document called **Rules of Engagement** in which he defines what techniques he will use, and what are the allowerd permissions for him, and it acts as a contract between him and the company.

## Pentesting methodologies
* Methodologies are the steps taken by a tester to apply an engagement
* practical methodologies are smart, and no one fits all, so each time you need to customize a specific attack or attempt on your case. 
* methodologies have general themes:
  1. Information gathering: in this stage, the tester collect as much publically accessibile information about the target/organisation as possible.
  2. Enumeration & Scanning: This stage involves discovering applications and services running on the systems. to find potentially vulnerable server.
  3. Exploitation: this stage involves leveraging vulnerabilities discovered on a system or application. using public exploits or crafting new exploit.
  4. Post-Exploitation: it contains sub-steps:
     1. what other hosts can be targeted
     2. What additional information can we gather from the host now as privileged user
     3. covering tracks
     4. reporting
### OSSTMM 
* The Open Source security Testing Methodology Manual
* it provides a detailed framework of testing strategies for systems, softwares, applications, communications and the human aspect of cybersecurity.
### OWASP
* Open Web Application Security Project
* framework that is community-driven, and frequently updated used to test the security of web applications and services.

## BOX Testing
* There are three primary scopes when testing an application or service
  * Black-Box
  * Grey-Box
  * White-Box
### Black Box
* It is a high level process, where the attacker is not given any information about the inner workings of the application
* the tester acts as a normal user, testing the functionality of the application
* it is the most diffcult, and time consuming test.

### Gray Box
* this is the most popular for testing
* the tester have some limited knowledge of the internal components of the application or the software. 
* but he still act as normal user, and test the functionality.

### White Box
* this is low level process usually used by the developer to test the application before release. 
* the tester have the full knowledge about the application.
